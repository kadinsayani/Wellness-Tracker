# Wellness Tracker

## About
*Project for CPSC 219*
WellnessTracker is a Java application that tracks wellness metrics such as steps, water intake, exercise, and also does food tracking. Food Tracking is accomplished by using CalorieNinja's natural language processing API (https://rapidapi.com/user/calorieninjas) to retrieve calories for a user inputed query.

## Development Environment

For my project I chose to use the Ecplise IDE. For my first demo I used VIM and javac, however, I decided to switch to Eclipse for my second demo because I wanted an environment with a debugger, JUnit support, a project explorer, and a marketplace.
